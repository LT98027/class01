    <p>It's "just" an ice cream shop. <i>Why is there always a line?!</i> This is probably your first thought, especially if you've never had their ice cream. But let me tell you, it's worth it. Namely because all of their ice creams have a silky, smooth texture and well balanced flavors.</p>

    <p><b>Definitely a solid ice cream shop!</b> The line is long here, but it goes by pretty quickly. I was surprised at how minimal the selection of flavors were, but at least they were good! The ice cream texture is solid and creamy, which is what I like. I hate gelato textured ice cream.</p>
